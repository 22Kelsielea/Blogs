<h1 id="spanish-songs-to-improve-your-grammar">5 Spanish Songs to Improve Your Grammar</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>So you want to improve your understanding of Spanish grammar, but don’t want to spend hours reading a textbook? Here are five Spanish songs that will help you solidify your understanding of 5 different grammar concepts.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of my favorite things to do is discover new music. I remember as a moody middle school student spending hours on    It is the only approach I have found to practicing grammar structures over and over again without dying of boredom. Generally, I use Spotify recommendations to find new songs and then google the official lyrics to these songs. First, I listen to the song several times (at least 6 or 7) while following along with the lyrics. Then I do a mental translation to make sure I have an understanding of the overall message of the song. (Many times I have to use Word Reference or Spanishdict in order to piece together the meaning.) Lastly, I start singing and sometimes even dancing along! Here are 5 songs that I have found especially helpful in solidifying my use of different grammar structures.</p>
<ol>
<li>Tenemos Historia - Raquel Sophia</li>
</ol>
<p>This song tells the story of a woman meeting up with her ex sometime after the break up. She outlines the painful process of going from lovers to just friends. The lyrics jump from the way the relationship is now to the way things used to be which gives us a clear example of how to switch from present tense to the imperfect. Plus it is a great ballad to belt out!</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Mujer Modelo - Francisca Valenzuela</li>
</ol>
<p>Feminism at its finest! This is an older song, but the lyrics are jam packed with messages of self-confidence and breaking free of society’s expectations of women. There are also several instances of using “Me gusta” and “Me importa” in an authentic way.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Pa Olvidarte - ChoQuibTown</li>
</ol>
<p>This is smooth song with a slower tempo making it easier for a Spanish learner to recognize words and sing along. The lyrics are written to an ex that is terribly missed. So much so that the singers have to drink to forget. There are examples of one of the most difficult grammar concepts to learn, the subjunctive. (ex. If you knew how many times I dreamed of you coming back.)</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>La Paga - Juanes</li>
</ol>
<p>Artistically, this song uses the repetition of each line to further illustrate the emotional and mental anguish of the singer who is deep in the clutches of a hot and cold relationship. This repetition is perfect for someone wanting to practice the Spanish past tense. You can listen to the first line and then repeat. I would also recommend watching the official music video at least once. If you have ever wondered what a depressed Mickey Mouse would look like, Juanes has the answer! The video shows what I imagine the Simpson’s version of the beloved character.</p>
<ol start="6">
<li>Duele - Bomba Estereo</li>
</ol>
<p>OK, I will admit that this song made the list partially because Bomba Estero is my favorite band with songs in Spanish. They have such a unique sound and each of their songs are distinct from the others.<br>
In this particular song, there are examples of one way to express the future tense (ex. “volverás”) I also found it helpful in using the verb “dejar.”</p>
